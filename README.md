# About The Project
A Python version using Streamlit framework of the original <a href="https://github.com/theEmperorofDaiViet/eat-and-fit.git"><b>Eat & Fit</b></a> application - a simple <i>knowledge based system</i> using Fuzzy Logic to provide weight-loss guide consist of a diet plan and a workout plan based on user's current state.

> **Warning**: The diagnosis of body fatness and the weight-loss plan generated by this application is just imitation for programming purpose. You <b>should not</b> follow them. To get the right instructions, you should use actual weight-loss applications, or better yet, go to the doctor.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Before cloning and using this application, you'll need to install these things on your computer:
* [Python 3.10.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/): Streamlit is a app framework in Python language, so you need to have Python installed to run this application. I used Python 3.10.2, but I think it works fine with some other releases as well.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): You can choose any IDE or Text Editor that you want. To build a simple application like this, I recommend <b>Visual Studio Code</b>.
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. Open the terminal and type this command to install Streamlit:
  ```sh
  pip install streamlit
  ```
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Open the terminal and type this command to install Numpy:
  ```sh
  pip install numpy
  ```
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Open the terminal and type this command to install Matplotlib:
  ```sh
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
* [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/): a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day.
* [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/): a desktop application for browsing and editing SQLite database files. It is aimed for people, who know what SQLite is, or what relational databases are in general.

## Installation
You can install this application by cloning this repository into your current working directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/theEmperorofDaiViet/eat-and-fit.streamlit.git
```
After cloning the repository, you can open the project by Visual Studio Code. To run the application, open a terminal and type:
```sh
streamlit run eat_and_fit.py
```
As usual, the app should automatically open in a new tab in your browser. It runs on port 8501 by default.

Fast enough, huh? Let's stop for a while and take a look at the project's structure:

## Project Explorer

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images\explorer.png" width="800px"></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>
      <p>
        The first subfolder, which named <b><i>algorithm</i></b>, is a package containing the algorithm used in the project. In this case, I used Fuzzy Logic, so there is a Python file named <code>fuzzy_logic.py</code> to implement it. I defined a rule table as a 2-dimensional numpy array and provided functions to perform each step of Fuzzy Logic: fuzzification, fuzzy inference and defuzzification. In each function, I put some <code>print()</code> functions to print the calculations. When running the app, you can see the results in the terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second subfolder is <b><i>database</i></b>. The <code>eatandfit.db</code> file is the SQLite database of this application. You just need only it to use database in this app. But I still provided <code>.sql</code> files in the <b><i>scripts</i></b> subfolder to show the structure of each table in the database. You could modify these scripts and execute them to create another database that you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third subfolder, <b><i>images</i></b>, contains the images used in this application. I stored all images of dishes as <code>blob</code> type in the database and used <code>base64</code> to decode them back to <code>.jpeg</code> images for  displaying. But I still provided them in the <b><i>dishes</i></b> subfolder for you to check.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourth subfolder, which named <b><i>models</i></b>, is a package containing all the model class of this application. They are seperated into two <code>.py</code> files named <code>eat.py</code> and <code>fit.py</code>, respectively. The former  consists of all the classes needed to make a diet plan, and the latter consists of all the classes needed to make a workout plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final subfolder, which named <b><i>pages</i></b>, contains all <code>.py</code> files which will be loaded as pages by streamlit. Their names will be transformed to page names in the sidebar of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the last thing to focus on is the <code>eat_and_fit.py</code> file. It is the "main" file of this application and will be loaded as the home page. That's why we type it's name in the command to run the app.
      </p>

# References
I want to say a big thanks to [<b>Eat This Much</b>](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) and [<b>Muscle & Strength</b>](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/). I used some of their knowledge in diet and workout to build this project, but I also adjusted these knowledge a bit to match my programming idea. So, again:

> **Warning**: <b>DO NOT</b> trust in the plan in this application. You should go to [<b>Eat This Much</b>](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) and [<b>Muscle & Strength</b>](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/)'s website to see the <b>RIGHT</b> instructions.
